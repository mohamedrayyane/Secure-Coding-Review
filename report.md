# 📄 Secure Coding Review Report

## 🔐 Project: Flask Login Application Review

---

### 1️⃣ **Overview**

This report summarizes the secure code review conducted on a simple Flask web application that implements a user login functionality. The objective of this review was to identify common security vulnerabilities, demonstrate how to exploit them, and provide secure coding recommendations.

---

### 2️⃣ **Tools Used**

- **Static Code Analyzer**: Bandit (Python security linter)
- **Manual Code Review**: Line-by-line inspection
- **Technologies Involved**: Flask, SQLite, Python 3

---

### 3️⃣ **Identified Vulnerabilities**

#### 🔴 1. SQL Injection
- **Location**: Line using `.format()` in vulnerable_code.py
- **Description**: User inputs were directly embedded into SQL queries without sanitization.
- **Risk**: Allows attackers to modify queries and gain unauthorized database access.
- **Example Payload**: `admin' --`
- **Severity**: Critical

#### 🔴 2. Plaintext Password Storage
- **Location**: User passwords stored directly in the database.
- **Description**: No password hashing or encryption used.
- **Risk**: Entire password database exposed if compromised.
- **Severity**: Critical

#### 🔴 3. Debug Mode Enabled in Production
- **Location**: `app.run(debug=True)`
- **Description**: Shows detailed error messages that may expose sensitive information.
- **Risk**: Information leakage, potential for further exploitation.
- **Severity**: High

#### 🔴 4. Lack of Session Management
- **Location**: No session/token issued after successful login.
- **Risk**: Authentication mechanism weak; no state management.
- **Severity**: Medium

#### 🔴 5. No Rate Limiting / Brute Force Protection
- **Description**: Unlimited login attempts allowed.
- **Risk**: Susceptible to automated credential stuffing attacks.
- **Severity**: Medium

---

### 4️⃣ **Fixes Applied**

#### ✅ SQL Injection
- Implemented **parameterized queries** using `?` placeholders to safely inject user input.

#### ✅ Password Security
- Used **bcrypt hashing algorithm** to hash and store passwords securely.

#### ✅ Debug Mode
- Disabled `debug=True` to prevent information leakage.

#### ✅ Session Management
- Introduced Flask session to store user login state securely.

#### ✅ Further Improvements Suggested
- Implement rate limiting (e.g., Flask-Limiter)
- CSRF protection (e.g., Flask-WTF)
- Input validation & output encoding

---

### 5️⃣ **Bandit Static Analysis Result**

- Detected SQL injection vulnerability on unsanitized string formatting.
- Warned about hardcoded debug mode.
- No additional high severity issues after applying fixes.

---

### 6️⃣ **Summary**

Secure coding practices such as **input validation, secure password storage, parameterized queries, and session management** are essential to protect web applications from common attack vectors such as **SQL injection, credential theft, and brute force attacks**.

---

✅ **Status after Review:**
- Critical issues fixed
- Code follows secure coding guidelines
- Ready for further security hardening and deployment
